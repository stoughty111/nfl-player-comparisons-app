# NFL Player Comparisons
A small full-stack app that compares 2024 NFL player season statistics. The backend is an Azure Function (C#) that loads player profiles, fetches season stats from [SportsDataIO](https://sportsdata.io/), and returns two player objects. The frontend is a React app (Vite + MUI) that posts player names and renders side‚Äëby‚Äëside stats.

## Run Locally
### 1. api (FootballApp):
**In Visual Studio Code:**
1. Install .NET 8 (check installation via `dotnet --version`)
2. Install [Azure Function Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=macos%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
3. Install the Azure Functions VS Code extension
4. In the FootballApp folder:
    - Create a `local.settings.json` file and copy the contents from the sample file [local.settings.json.example](https://github.com/stoughty111/nfl-player-comparisons-app/blob/main/api/FootballApp/local.settings.json.example)
    - Run the following commands in the terminal:
        ```{}
